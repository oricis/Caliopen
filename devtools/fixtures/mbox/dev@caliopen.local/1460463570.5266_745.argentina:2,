Nope, you were supposed to either abort the merge or fix the conflict(s)
and then stage the resulting changes and "git commit" them.

See "git help merge", section "How to resolve conflicts".

git merge --abort

And that was the only conflict markers that should have been edited.  It
seems you really did another manual "git merge" with the arguments in
the wrong order instead.

Yes, although some distributions have it in a separate package since it
requires Tk.
