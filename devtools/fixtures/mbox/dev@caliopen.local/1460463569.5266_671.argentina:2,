Aha!  So we agree: there's no reason to worry about parse-partial-sexp,
since at this point pretty much all modes rely on syntax-ppss (other
than CC-modes, obviously).

Right.  But I don't see it as a problem in parse-partial-sexp, rather
than a problem in syntax.el.

scan-sexps will complain about unmatched parens and things like that if
it bumps into point-min/max.  Same for re-search-*.  I think you've just
been too often exposed to the use of (parse-partial-sexp 1 ...) where
the resulting signal bites you right away, whereas many other functions
won't signal an error and will instead do *something* (which may not
always be incorrect, but may often enough still result in acceptable
behavior).

CC-modes is definitely a very special case here.
We should aim to limit the amount of changes in most major modes, so
better not pay too much attention to cc-mode from that point of view.

Sounds like a problem in cc-mode, which will require changes in
cc-mode.  The generic code shouldn't worry about that.

Thanks.

That would definitely be an error, so if you bump into such a case
please report it.

I prefer to say that "any major mode which wants to play with the new
snazzy multi-mode feature needs to be adjusted (e.g. with prog-widen)".
It's perfectly fine if some major modes don't play along correctly until
they're fixed.

"Try to get multi-mode working without touching anyone's code"
(e.g. using advice) is great, but we already have packages which do that.

The "is more general" I was quoting was talking about the ways the
generic code can call the major-mode-specific code.  If this is more
generic, it means the major-mode-specific code needs to handle more
situations (e.g. STRING-BEFORE appearing not just at the beginning of
a chunk).

I don't understand: every major mode's indentation code will have to pay
attention to the STRING-BEFORE/AFTER that it receives from the generic
code and will have to do something with it (it can ignore it but at the
cost of sub-optimal results).  And AFAIK this can only be done by the
major mode's code, not the generic mode's code.
