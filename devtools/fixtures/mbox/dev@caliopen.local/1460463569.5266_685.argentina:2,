Why is it a problem for column number to start at zero?  Emacs always
worked like that.

No.  You could, of course, come up with a mode-line format that would
display column-number + 1, but that would only change this on display,
not internally.

Then you'd need to change every interface that accepts or returns
column numbers, like move-to-column, posn-at-point, etc.  Is it really
worth it?
