Decision of how much to indent. Inner mode just doesn't have a complete picture
of what is going on. Just having access to previous chunk is not enough.

Note that I don't mind FIRST-COLUMN functionality. I think it's harmless and
probably useful. I mostly mind the last two arguments of
prog-indentation-context.

Good ;)

Yeh. That's the sucky part. My hope is that BEFORE-STRING will be seldom
used. Given that this case applies only to continuation chunks and assuming that
multi-mode engine can identify those (at least at multi-mode level) this is a
reasonable trade off IMO. In polymode I haven't even got down to indentation of
continuation chunks yet. They are not that common in literate programming.

Performance is not a primary concern for indentation. Correctness and conceptual
cleanness is at a much higher stake here. My hope is that generic helper
functions can be optimized to re-use same temp buffer for multiple invocations
of calculate-indent-function.

Indeed. But this information is trivial to retrieve from STRING-AFTER.

Indeed. I was not thinking about algorithmic complexities.

AFAIK if second element is removed, the third one should go as well. That leaves
only FIRST-COLUMN then, which I personally don't mind.

I think as long as low level code uses BEGV and ZV instead of BEG and Z
everything should be fine. That is with an implicit assumption that hard limits
are always wider than the current visual narrowing which is a reasonable
contract IMO.

Even better, as long as low level routines use BEG and Z consistently (and it
looks like they do) BEG and Z can be modified to take care of
hard-widen-limits. This might be the easiest solution. In any case going through
all C code and checking usage of widen is not such an insurmountable task.

Right. Those stale values won't occur in multi-modes because both syntax-ppss
and parse-partial-sexp will always operate on same hard-narrowed regions.
