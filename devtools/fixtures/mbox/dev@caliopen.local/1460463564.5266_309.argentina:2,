For the current discussion the part that saves bookmarks is
not important.

The important part is that you can build a "bookmark object" which should
contain enough data to reproduce the current buffer&position.

You might be able to do that, but what I was proposing was not to let
users use the bookmark functionality, but simply to have a default
special-mode-revert-buffer function which would do something along
the lines of:

    (defun special-mode-revert-function ()
      (let ((here (funcall bookmark-make-record-function)))
        (erase-buffer)
        (bookmark-goback here)))
