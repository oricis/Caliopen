As explained, the SMIE indentation has no such "summary of context".
The only context it could use is either a position or the complete text
before that position.

Yes, there are simple cases we know how to handle.  The problem is the
general case, along with the work to modify the existing indentation
codes to be able to generate and use that data.

Consider

    x = a << b + c * d

the code after this line can be indented in various different ways:

                 * e
or
             + e
or
        == e
or
  ; e

And of course, in this example, I put all relevant operators, but in
practice they'll generally be on different lines.  And SMIE (which
supports that kinds of indentation, e.g. in sm-c-mode) doesn't
pre-compute that context: it's only when it sees the "+" at the
beginning of line that it moves back over higher-precedence operators to
find the matching alignment spot.

In theory, SMIE could try to create the kind of context you're thinking
of, but that would amount to a complete rewrite (and it would likely be
very difficult if not impossible to make it work with existing
smie-rules-functions, so it'd break backward compatibility).
