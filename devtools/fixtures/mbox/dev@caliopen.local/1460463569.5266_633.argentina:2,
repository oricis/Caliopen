OK.

Haha!

If it's got its own "chunk", then yes.

OK.

OK.

Right, since the beginning of line is still in latex-mode, the "<<foo,
some_arg=4>>= some_call(blabla)" line would be indented by latex-mode.
I.e. the generic code would go to BOL, and call latex-mode's indentation
while setting prog-indentation-context with an "end of chunk" that's
at point.

Not sure what PREVIOUS-CHUNK has to do with it.

Since it's not on its own line, I don't see why it would be an issue
for indentation.

That's also one of the reasons why I didn't want to impose narrowing in
prog-indentation-context.

IIUC, we have here a tight interleaving of lots of little chunks,
alternating between HTML and ..[according to duckduckgo].. Ruby.

Another approach would be to consider it as a sequence of chunks, rather
than as chunks of one mode nested in another.  So each chunk controls
the FIRST-COLUMN of the next chunk.

In any case, this seems messy.

Ah, now I see a use of STRING-BEFORE and STRING-AFTER, thanks.

This case of STRING-BEFORE being "\n" is very special: in SMIE, the core
indentation function (smie-indent-calculate) basically behaves as if
it's always called with STRING-BEFORE="\n".

IOW, we could define prog-indent-function as always behaving "as if
STRING-BEFORE was \n".  In the normal case, the foo-calculate-indent
function is called at the beginning of line anyway, so adding
a STRING-BEFORE="\n" won't affect its behavior.

As for STRING-AFTER, the example is compelling, but I don't yet
understand really how it would all work out overall.
I'm thinking of cases like:

    <% 3.times do %>
      <li>
        some text
        <% if signed_in? -%>
          <%= link_to t('.sign_out'), sign_out_path, :method => :delete %>
        <% else -%>
          <%= link_to t('.sign_in'), sign_in_path %>
        <% end -%>
      </li>
    <% end %>

How should the "generic" code that links HTML and Ruby know when to
indent using the HTML indentation code and when to use the Ruby
indentation rules?

Maybe my suggestion of considering it as a sequence of chunks (where each
chunk controls the FIRST-COLUMN of the next chunk) could work, but it's
far from obvious.
