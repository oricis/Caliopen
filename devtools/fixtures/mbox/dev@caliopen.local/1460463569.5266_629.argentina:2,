How/why?  Can you give some concrete scenario?

Because you need it for *everything* that looks at the buffer.
Why should parse-partial-sexp be different from (say) scan-sexps?

Bug#22983 should be fixed by widening, indeed, but it should be done in
syntax.el.  Widening in parse-partial-sexp would only address some cases
but not all (e.g. the syntax-begin-function cases or the
syntax-propertize-function cases).  Those other cases can only be fixed
in syntax.el.

I'm not familiar with those, so if you could give some examples it
would help us judge if they would indeed benefit from a fix in
parse-partial-sexp rather than elsewhere.

No: POS should be within point-min/max.

Replace all your widen calls with calls to `prog-widen' and you get
the same result (since (nth 1 prog-indentation-context) is basically
another name for your hard-widen-limit).  So I don't think prog-widen is
that very complicated.

As for prog-first-column the local major mode can just ignore it in
which case the multi-mode can do the same that you do.  It's only useful
if you need/want to provide a more complex behavior than what
polymode supports.  So, of course, it's more complex.

[ Note: In my mind, the "natural main case" for multi-mode indentation
  is when you call the indentation function on the *first position* of
  a span.  But you seem to look at it from the other end, where you call
  the indentation function on the *last position* of the previous span.
  I think I'm beginning to see why.  ]

Note that "is more general" here means that the major mode's function
has to handle more cases, so it would seem to fundamentally require more
work on the major mode's side.

Good point.  I didn't think of that.  Do you make use of that
possibility, and/or can you give an example where it's useful?

Maybe it's because I'm not familiar with noweb, but I didn't understand
this example.  It looks like a very interesting example, so could you go
over it again in much more detail?
