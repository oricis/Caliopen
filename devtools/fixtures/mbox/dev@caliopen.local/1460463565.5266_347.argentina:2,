The user will hit `r'/`l'.  I mean, I do.

I agree that they aren't very mnemonic bindings, but those are the
bindings that all modes that I know of that has a history uses.  I don't
even know what they stand for.  "Return"?  "L..."  uhm...

If you want to have an additional set of keystrokes available, I'm all
for that, but that's an orthogonal issue.  All these modes should have
the same keystrokes for these navigation commands.

I obviously chose 100 as a number that is larger than anybody could
reasonably want.  But I could well imagine 10.  Perhaps somebody would
want 20?  So we leave it at 100, and nobody will ever complain, and we
don't need to offer this as a customisation option.

There are no downsides to 100 that I can see.
