How about an extension to the parse-partial-sexp (etc.) code?  For
example, a feature I would call an "island", where a character could be
marked with the "island start" syntax-table property, and another
character lower down could be marked with the "island end" character.
parse-partial-sexp, on encountering an island start syntax would somehow
stack the current parse state and start a new one with a different syntax
table.  The parse state, instead of consisting of the 10 elements
currently, would in general have 10n elements, where n is the depth of
nesting.
