I must admit that I find it hard to agree.  I do not see how the OS, or =
the Emacs version, or=20
the combination of both could be used to identify you as a person.  But =
if the can't, why
would you consider this information private?  And even if it could, =
doesn't it pale beside
the information that is necessarily send to the archive (e.g. your IP, a =
partial list of
the packages you're using, etc.)?

I think that our desire as package maintainers to learn how and where =
their packages are
used is legitimate.  It helps us to direct our efforts and our time to =
those enviroments
that matter and to make informed choices about what degree of backwards =
compatibility we
should offer.  In the absence of any concrete risk, I tend to value our =
desire higher=20
than the interest of users to keep data private that can only be used =
for anonymous usage=20
statistics.

Now, I understand that I'm biased, and that your priorities may be =
fundamentally different
from mine.  But I believe that the availability of some halfway solid =
statistics would
improve our ability to make informed decisions about our packages.=
