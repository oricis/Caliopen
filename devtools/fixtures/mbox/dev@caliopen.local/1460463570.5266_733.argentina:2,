I think a UI page like "chrome://flags/" in google chrome is better for
this function. In this page, we can show all compitable options for user
to choose.

For expert user, we can provide a file like emacs-24-compitable.el (with
emacs 25 distribution). After loading the file, all behaviors are the
same as emacs 24. This can also be used by packages.
