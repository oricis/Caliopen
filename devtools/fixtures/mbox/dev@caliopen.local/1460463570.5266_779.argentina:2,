For the sake of completeness, my 'git merge' man page for 2.8.0.rc3 says
(in the DESCRIPTION section):

       Warning: Running git merge with non-trivial uncommitted changes
       is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that
       is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

We'll just have to disagree about the "severely broken" part.

I assume you mean a better idea about Alan's wishes..  Well, I actually
followed those threads, but what was asked for here does not remind me
of them.  Sorry if I was missing the point.
