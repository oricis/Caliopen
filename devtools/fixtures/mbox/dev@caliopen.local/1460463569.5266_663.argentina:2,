That's a misunderstanding of what `font-lock-dont-widen' is.  It's
purely a signal to font-lock.  Its doc string makes clear that it's
intended for use by major modes.  It is for a major mode to set this
flag, not to act on it.

CC Mode absolutely needs to widen, to get the context necessary for
correct fontification and indentation (which can be an arbitrary depth).

Reading some of the posts on emacs-devel today, it strikes me that
narrowing might be the wrong tool for marking the boundaries of distinct
regions where different major modes are in effect.  It seems to cause
nothing but trouble.  I don't know what the right tool is, and it may
not currently exist in Emacs.  But it might be a good use of time to
work out what properties such boundary markers ought to have, and if
necessary, to implement them.
