Is there a way of asking "if I attempt git merge, will there be any
conflicts?"?  It would be nice to find this out before one's working
directory gets lots of uncommitted changes.

Is there a way of recovering after doing git pull, when git has already
written all the pulled changes to the working directory?  Is there some
way of saying git undo-partial-pull, leaving the working directory as it
was before the pull, and cancelling the merge which git has started?

Sorry, I wasn't very clear.  What I meant was, is there a way of
finishing the merge locally, then pushing real changes without the
confusing "pseudo-merge" escaping upstream with them?

When I did git pull, there were, let's say, 20 commits.  19 of these
could have been moved directly into my local repository; only one had a
conflict.  It would be nice to be able to fix the local repo, so that
the "pseudo-merge" of these 19 blameless commits remains a purely local
affair, and doesn't get pushed upstream.
