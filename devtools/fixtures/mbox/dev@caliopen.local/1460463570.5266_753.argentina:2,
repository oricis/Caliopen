Rebasing makes sense for Alan's use case. He was working on the fix anyway, so 
retesting was not that big a deal for him. Conversely, he's more of an Emacs 
expert than a Git expert and merge conflicts are more of an hassle for him. This 
particular case did not benefit much from the advantages of merging over 
rebasing; quite the contrary.

As one becomes more of a Git expert, merging becomes more attractive. It does 
take some getting used to, though.
