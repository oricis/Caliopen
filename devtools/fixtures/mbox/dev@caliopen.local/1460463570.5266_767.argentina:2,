I think 'git pull' has been discussed on this list before.  Others feel
differently about this issue, but I strongly advise anyone against using
'git pull', and instead suggest you do 'git fetch' (maybe --all).

*After* seeing what has happened to the remote branches, you can decide
whether a merge or a rebase is in order.  Or you spot an unwanted
discrepancy, and can fix it, instead of git telling you to manually
merge (although admittedly I do not quite follow that part).

Please note that *all* commits and merges happen locally.  The user can
only push changes back to the remote by an explicit action, with all
intended and unintended effects.
