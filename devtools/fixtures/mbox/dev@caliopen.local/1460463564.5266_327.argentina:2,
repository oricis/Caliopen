I know for markdown-mode on MELPA, I added a "live-preview" feature which
displays the rendered markdown file alongside in an eww (or other) buffer as the
user edits, and I wanted to make any windows displaying that buffer have the
idea of "not moving." I played around a bit with some ideas and thought of
recording the scroll and window-point for all windows displaying the buffer, and
the visual lines between the scroll and point, and then restored the scroll,
window-point, and visual line difference for each window when the buffer was
regenerated. I also had a special case for when the window-point was equal to
point-min or point-max, in which case I just scrolled the buffer all the way
down or up.

This isn't likely to apply to a lot of other modes, but it's just a thought
about what other information might be useful if you wanted to implement
something like this.
