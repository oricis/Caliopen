Interactive or not, doesn't matter. The danger is the whatever eslip used within
hard-narrowed regions.

I agree completely. But I think defining an "whole&sole" universe need not
involve current implementation of narrowing. It's about inability to widen not
ability to narrow. My patch didn't even touch `narrow` because that's not
needed.

There is no real need to invent extra type of narrowing. It's a lot of extra
work with no additional benefit. It's simply enough to define hard limits that
none of the standard functions can lift.

In order to define a different type of narrowing you would need to introduce
alternatives to BEGV, BEGV_BYTE ZV, ZV_BYTE and the hunt them everywhere where
BEGV or BEGV_BYTE are used right now.

What concrete semantics do you have in mind? If a user or elisp already narrowed
the buffer, will hard narrowing re-narrow it? If user typed within a hard region
the hard narrowed region, will the upper hard limit expand just as ZV does?

My approach is simpler and leaves current narrowing functionality alone. You set
the limits and allow narrowing happening inside those limits normally. Even
widen cannot lift those limits. You create a small universe within the buffer
with only one exit (set-widen-limits nil nil).

You might end up loosing text outside of the bounds if you modify the buffer and
then call widen, but that's by design and this is how it's different from visual
narrowing. Hard limits stay the same irrespective of what happens to the buffer.

The problem is not hypothetical. It's occurring right now. If you impose limits
in order to do font-lock and font-lock-fontify-region-function changes those
limits that screws your multi mode. That's what is happening with current
narrowing/widening mechanism and that's precisely the reason for extra widen
limits in the first place.
