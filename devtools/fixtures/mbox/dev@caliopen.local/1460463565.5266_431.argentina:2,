BTW, another solution for fill-paragraph is to reimplement it from
scratch such that it doesn't "unfill+refill".  I.e. it could instead
loop go to each LF in the paragraph, such if that LF is found to be "at
the right spot", it moves on, if it's "too soon", then it removes it,
and if it's "too far" then it adds another somewhere earlier.

This would naturally lead to the result that the buffer would stay
unmodified if there was no change.
