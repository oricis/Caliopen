It is not clear which one you are talking about.  Are you talking
about IceCat?  If so, yes, that user-agent string is designed to equal
what many other machines on the net actually send.

Isn't url-user-agent used for ALL sites?  If so, the question of what to use
is not part of a package.el discussion.
