You mean it should ignore the current (user)narrowing?  Why?
I'd think that if something needs to ignore the (user)narrowing it'd be
parse-partial-sexp's *caller* but not parse-partial-sexp itself.

You mean: as opposed to (max FROM (point-min))?

I disagree.  Functions should usually not accept to talk about positions
outside of the point-min/max range.

Notice how syntax-ppss is different in this regard: since it doesn't
receive FROM, that same rule doesn't prevent syntax-ppss from widening
to (car hard-widen-limits).

I'd be curious to know in which circumstances (i.e. specific code in
specific packages) this would make a difference.  As mentioned above,
I think these cases would be better fixed by changing the calling code
to perform widening before calling parse-partial-sexp.

I understand that's your claim, but I don't understand why/how this is
different between the two proposals.

Same here.

>   - Arguably calculate-indent-function is a simpler concept to grasp

As mentioned, I fully agree with the need to replace
indent-line-function with calculate-indent-function (tho I like to name
it prog-indent-function).  So the difference is w.r.t your
STRONG-BEFORE/AFTER: which code provides them, which code obeys them,
and how that compares to the way prog-indentation-context is provided
and obeyed.

My hunch is that if STRING-BEFORE/AFTER don't matter, then it should not
be hard to come up with a generic function in prog.el which can be
invoked with a one liner in the major mode (assuming the major mode
sets (prog|calculate)-indent-function).
