You can simulate islands by marking inner spans as comments with comment classes
(11 and 12). I used those in polymode in the past, but not anymore. It's not
that useful. Most of the parsing that modes do is regex based. So if a mode
author decides to regexpf for a wiki link on a full buffer after widening it,
islands won't help.

As Dmitry mentioned, there is little multi-mode cannot do with advising
syntax-ppss. The issue is still that parse-partial-sexp blows with narrowed code
and you cannot advice it.

IMO the most useful direction for multi-modes is to add a hard narrowing that
Stephen mentioned in the other thread. `syntax-ppss-dont-widen` goes in that
direction, but it doesn't address the issue of distinguishing between user
narrowing and "hard narrowing" in multi modes.
