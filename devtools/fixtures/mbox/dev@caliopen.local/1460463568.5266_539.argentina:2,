Well, yes. c-mode is special, as usual. That should be workable if CC 
Mode starts using prog-widen instead of widen, though.

I'm not 100% happy with it either.

Too bad you were not around when this addition was discussed.

IIRC, using first-column is fairly justified, the outer mode can't add 
extra indentation to the submode is a reliable, sane way (though I've 
also been hacking around that quite successfully). Here's the full 
discussion:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg00431.html
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-02/msg00290.html

with my messages further down.

Indeed. In js-mode's case, the offending code is called from 
font-lock-keywords, for example.

Right! At the very least, I we should extract the second element of 
prog-indentation-context into a separate variable, and make prog-widen 
more prominent.

But a proper implementation of hard-widen would be even better in my 
book. Although someone would need to comb through all low-level 
functions, at least, and decide which of them need to call 
widen-internal, and which will be fine with just widen.

Are you interested in working on a patch? Also Cc'ing Stefan.

Looking back on it, it seems prog-indentation-context was merged too 
early: it only has one usage so far, so it's not clear if the approach 
is generally viable.

Christoph sort of promised to add support in CC Mode, but then 
disappeared. Which is not so surprising, that stuff is difficult.

This is not too different what I was saying, I think. That discussion is 
fairly long, though, and it veered off to the side.

AFAICT, though, the ultimate justification for having first-column is 
Python's indentation cycling behavior: 
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-02/msg01096.html

Which is not that convincing, but makes some things clearner anyway.

But the last element, previous-chunks, is still not used anywhere in 
Emacs. I think including it turned out to be a mistake, or at least 
premature.

Probably.

ruby-syntax-propertize also does some involved parsing, but as long as 
there's no `widen' there, we should be fine.
