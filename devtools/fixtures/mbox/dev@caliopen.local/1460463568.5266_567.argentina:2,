STRING-BEFORE/STRING-AFTER/PREVIOUS-CHUNKS look like the main complexity
(from smie.el's point of view, they all seem pretty painful to support).

The reason is that your suggestion risks breaking code since it changes
the behavior of `widen'.

Maybe the breakage would be extremely limited or even not exist at all,
in which case the tradeoff is probably worth it.  My gut feeling is that
it's too risky, but that's just my gut feeling.

Note also that most modes don't bother using widen, and search&replace
is pretty easy to do.  But if my fear is unfounded, then indeed it's
better to just change `widen' directly.
