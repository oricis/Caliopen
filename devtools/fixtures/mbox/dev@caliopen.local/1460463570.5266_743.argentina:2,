It was git that prepared the merge, not me.  What happened was that the
"more recent" commit 22443312... created a conflict with the commits in
a git pull.  git, rather than aborting the pull operation, splurged the
contents of all the other commits in the pull into my working directory,
saying "Conflict in ....  You need to merge".  I simply merged as
directed.

Is there a better way out of this situation than just merging as
directed?  Can one somehow get out of this partially completed git pull,
then redo it with --rebase?

This was what created the conflict, I think.

I haven't got gitk.  Is it supposed to be part of the main git
distribution?
