What decision? One case where the mode cannot return its proposed 
indentation at all, is when the resulting column would be negative. 
Using first-column can make it positive again via simple addition.

Using calculate-indent-function which returns a numeric value, would 
solve that as well, of course, at the expense of having to update all 
major modes out there, and documentation. And making whatever 
third-party guides are out there obsolete in this regard. I'm not really 
against that, mind you.

I'm not claiming that using previous-chunk is good.

Strings? Indentation engines do not deal with strings, they deal with 
buffer contents. Having them handle this possibility would also amount 
to sharing a part of multi-mode logic.

Instead, if you want to know what indentation an inner mode would return 
if STRING-BEFORE was before it, insert that string into the buffer 
(while inhibiting undo history). Call the indentation function, then 
remove the string. Any performance concerns with that?

Ruby doesn't. Most modes based on SMIE will need more than the previous 
line in the general case, too.

Almost all of them care whether the current line contains }, or `end', 
or `else', and so on.

Didn't you mention font-lock and syntax-propertize yourself? Why would 
they call a function that's solely dependent on an indentation variable?

In any case, your hard-narrowing proposal is very similar. Surely you 
don't want to keep the second element of prog-indentation-context after 
hard-narrowing becomes available?

OK, so *every* consumer of widen will have to obey the hard limits. That 
might work, if there's no low-level code that absolutely has to always 
be able to widen to the whole buffer.

If you want parse-partial-sexp to obey limits, you narrow the buffer 
around it.

That doesn't seem relevant. That bug is about stale cache values between 
different narrowing bounds.

I concur.
