I think your documentation might be outdated.  Here's what the "git
pull" man page I have says:

  In Git 1.7.0 or later, to cancel a conflicting merge, use git reset
  --merge. Warning: In older versions of Git, running git pull with
  uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it leaves you in a
  state that may be hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

  If any of the remote changes overlap with local uncommitted changes,
  the merge will be automatically cancelled and the work tree
  untouched. It is generally best to get any local changes in working
  order before pulling or stash them away with git-stash(1).

This is with Git 2.8.0.

IOW, for a recent enough Git, they _recommend_ stashing, but no longer
_warn_ about merging in this situation.  Which is exactly my
experience.

I agree that it's preferable to have a clean repo, but in practice it
doesn't always work to have it.  Being able to pull when you have
uncommitted changes is an important feature; a VCS that doesn't
support it is IMO severely broken, because it will get in the way.

You may wish re-reading some of Alan's past messages about his
adventures with Git, to get a better idea about that.
