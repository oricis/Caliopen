I don't see any extra work.  (narrow-to-region BEG END 'hard) would just
be the API used to set your hard limits, and that's all there is to it.

> If user typed within a hard region the hard narrowed region, will the

This is indispensable, yes.  No matter whether the hard limits are
folded int narrow-to-region or any other way: the upper limit has to be
a marker, and unless we strictly enforce that the hard limits can't be
circumvented at all, the lower limit would probably have to be a marker
as well.

That's also how I imagine (narrow-to-region BEG END 'hard) working.
It just won't allow widening outside of those hard limits.

Sounds like a wart.  What's the benefit?

It can't because we don't have hard limits right now.
